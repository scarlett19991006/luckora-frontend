        <h3><strong>Jackie Chan: The Dragon Who Understood His Fire</strong></h3>
        <p>In Chinese culture, being born in the Year of the Dragon is a symbol of greatness. Jackie Chan embodies that destiny in every leap, kick, and grin.</p>
      
        <p>Born in 1954, Jackie is a Wood Dragon — bold, ambitious, and endlessly creative. Dragons are magnetic, and Jackie’s energy on screen is nothing short of electric. But his rise to superstardom wasn’t just luck or talent — it was guided by something deeper: tradition.</p>
      
        <p>Jackie has long embraced the wisdom of the Chinese Zodiac and Feng Shui. He’s said to consult astrologers and Feng Shui masters when making life-changing decisions — from buying property to launching films. His former home in Hong Kong was designed in harmony with elemental forces. Water flowed near the entrance, believed to enhance wealth and career luck. Mirrors were avoided in rest spaces to protect his Chi. Even furniture placement aligned with Bagua principles — because Jackie believed that <em>prosperity follows flow</em>.</p>
      
        <p>In his 2012 film, <em>Chinese Zodiac</em>, Jackie didn’t just play a treasure hunter. He paid homage to the very system of ancient wisdom that shaped his life. The movie was his love letter to heritage, balance, and the ongoing dance between destiny and discipline.</p>
      
        <p>Jackie Chan may be a global icon, but in the eyes of the Chinese Zodiac, he’s simply a <strong>Dragon</strong> who understood his fire.</p>
