        <h3><strong>Bruce Lee: The Dragon Who Couldn’t Be Caged</strong></h3>
      
        <p>Bruce Lee wasn’t just a man — he was movement, myth, and fire. Born in 1940, the Year of the Dragon, Bruce embodied intensity and transformation. But behind his brilliance lived a storm of superstition, secrets, and spiritual warnings.</p>
      
        <p>From birth, Bruce was surrounded by whispers of danger. His family gave him the feminine name <strong>Sai-fon (細鳳)</strong> to hide him from vengeful spirits — a desperate attempt to protect their son from a mysterious <strong>family curse</strong> said to take the lives of male heirs. Some say this force stalked his bloodline for generations, hidden in shadows no martial art could block.</p>
      
        <p>And then, on <strong>July 20, 1973</strong>, Bruce Lee died suddenly at age 32. The official cause? <em>Cerebral edema</em> — swelling of the brain. But the circumstances were riddled with strange details:</p>
      
        <ul style="padding-left: 20px; line-height: 1.6;">
          <li>He had complained of headaches earlier that day.</li>
          <li>He took a simple painkiller, Equagesic.</li>
          <li>He lay down… and never woke up.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <p>Medical confusion mixed with ancient fear.  
        Some blamed an allergic reaction.  
        Others blamed <strong>Feng Shui misalignment</strong> in his home.  
        Many believed the <strong>curse had finally found him</strong>.</p>
      
        <p>The mystery deepened when his son, <strong>Brandon Lee</strong>, died tragically on a film set in 1993 — eerily, at age 28. Shot by a prop gun in a movie called <em>The Crow</em>, Brandon’s death mirrored the unfinished energy of his father’s legacy.</p>
      
        <p>Was it coincidence? Or the invisible threads of fate, Feng Shui, and ancient warning?</p>
      
        <p>To this day, Bruce Lee’s death remains one of the most iconic mysteries in modern history — a story not only of life and strength, but of destiny, legacy, and the Dragon’s final lesson:</p>
      
        <p><em>"Be water,"</em> he said. <strong>But even water can drown in silence.</strong></p>
